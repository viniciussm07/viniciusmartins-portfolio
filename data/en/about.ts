I have proficiency in consuming and developing REST APIs, especially in Javascript, and expertise in AWS cloud services. My journey includes not only technical excellence, but also solid experience in customer support in web environments, and working in a development team using the Git versioning tool. I'm currently studying Information Systems at USP in SÃ£o Carlos and looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge to projects that have positive impacts on users.`,
